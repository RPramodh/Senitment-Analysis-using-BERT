# Sentiment Analysis with BERT

## Overview
This project employs BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers), a cutting-edge natural language processing model, to perform sentiment analysis. Sentiment analysis involves the identification of sentiment (positive, negative, or neutral) expressed in a given text.

## Features
- **BERT Model:** Utilizes the power of BERT, a pre-trained transformer-based model, to capture contextual relationships in text data.
- **Fine-Tuning:** Fine-tunes the BERT model on a sentiment analysis dataset, adapting it to the specific task of sentiment classification.
- **Accuracy:** Achieves high accuracy in sentiment prediction by understanding complex contextual dependencies within sentences.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- PyTorch
- Hugging Face Transformers Library
- Google BERT LLM

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Run the sentiment analysis script on your text data using the provided notebook or script.

## Acknowledgments
- This project makes use of the Hugging Face Transformers library, simplifying interactions with transformer models like BERT.

## How to Contribute
Feel free to contribute by opening issues, providing suggestions, or submitting pull requests for enhancements.

## Future Improvements
- Explore different pre-processing techniques for text data.
- Experiment with other transformer models for comparison.
- Fine-tune hyperparameters for improved performance.
