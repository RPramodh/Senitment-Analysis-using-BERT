# Sentiment Analysis with BERT

## Overview
This project employs BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers), a cutting-edge natural language processing model, to perform sentiment analysis. Sentiment analysis involves the identification of sentiment (positive, negative, or neutral) expressed in a given text.

## Features
- **BERT Model:** Utilizes the power of BERT, a pre-trained transformer-based model, to capture contextual relationships in text data.
- **Fine-Tuning:** Fine-tunes the BERT model on a sentiment analysis dataset, adapting it to the specific task of sentiment classification.
- **Accuracy:** Achieves high accuracy in sentiment prediction by understanding complex contextual dependencies within sentences.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- TensorFlow
- Hugging Face Transformers Library

## Getting Started
