Certainly! Here's a sample description that you can use to showcase your sentiment analysis project using BERT on GitHub:

Sentiment Analysis with BERT
Overview
This project utilizes BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers), a state-of-the-art natural language processing model, for sentiment analysis. Sentiment analysis involves determining the sentiment (positive, negative, or neutral) expressed in a piece of text.

Features
BERT Model: The project leverages the power of BERT, a pre-trained transformer-based model, to understand contextual relationships in text data.
Fine-Tuning: The BERT model is fine-tuned on a sentiment analysis dataset to adapt it to the specific task of sentiment classification.
Accuracy: Achieves high accuracy in sentiment prediction by capturing complex contextual dependencies within sentences.
Technologies Used
Python
TensorFlow
Hugging Face Transformers Library
How to Use
Clone the repository to your local machine.
Install the required dependencies using pip install -r requirements.txt.
Run the sentiment analysis script on your text data using the provided notebook or script.
Dataset
The model was trained and evaluated on [Dataset Name], which contains [Number of Samples] labeled examples for sentiment analysis.
